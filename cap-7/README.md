# Motivation

Say you have the boring task of finding every phone number and email address in a long web page or document.

Design a phone and email extractor from the clipboard. This will need to do the following:
- Get the text off the clipboard
- Find all phone numbers and email address in the text
- Paste the onto the clipboard

### Practice Project

##### Strong Password

Write a function that usees regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight chars long, contains both uppercase and lower case chars, and has at least one digit. You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.

##### Regex Version of strip()

Write a function that takes a string and does the same thing as the `strip()` string method. If no other args are passed other than the string to strip, then whitespace chars will be removed from the beginning and end of the string. Otherwise, the chars specified in the second arg to the function will be removed from the string.
