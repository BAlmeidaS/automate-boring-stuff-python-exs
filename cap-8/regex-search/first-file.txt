There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains,
Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as 
he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him.
For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the 
Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for 
ever beyond its reach.
